Elasticsearch, Kibana and es-head in a box, protected by NGINX!

Setup of Elastic, Kibana and head plugin using Packer and Terraform.

== Build the AMI using Packer

This Packer setup depends on AWS credentials having been pre-configured. Before running, set the `AWS_PROFILE` environmental variable.

```
packer build elk.json
```

== Deploy using Terraform

See the `sample.tf` for a straightforward Terraform configuration to use the modules. Terraform also has a https://www.terraform.io/intro/[getting started guide].

One option is to clone this repository into a working subdirectory of your project to start using it. You could also refer to the module directly from Git:

....
module "ek" {
  source = "github.com/juxt/pack-ek//modules/ek?ref=0.1.0"
  # Declare variable inputs
  # ...
}
....

To use this module you need to provide the relevant variables that are declared at the top of `sample.tf`, you can do so either from the command line or from a tf.vars file. Assuming you went ahead and supplied the variables in a `dev.tfvars` file, then the Terraform commands to plan and to subsequently execute
provisioning would be:

Get the module ready:

....
terraform get
....

Make the Terraform plan

....
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars -out proposed.plan
....

Execute the plan:

....
terraform apply proposed.plan
....

You will need `htpasswd`.
